# Rental Car System(Amin)

# Introduction of the project:
The trust between contractors is one of the most important principles of the contract, which preserves the rights of the parties and prevents disputes from arising; therefore, "Amin" was chosen as the mediator to preserve the parties' rights
This will make it easier for both parties to rent cars at a time that is convenient for them
